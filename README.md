# (Ford Gobike System Data Exploration)
## by (Wilfred Onsongo)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in February 2019. This project explores the data in detail.


## Summary of Findings

> - Most of the rides took less than 20 Minutes to complete.
> - Majority of the rides were taken during the (7-9)am period in the morning and 4-7pm in the evening daily.
> - Thursday had the largest number of rides weekly and Saturday & Sunday had the least rides weekly.
> - 75% of the users were male and 2.1% of the users did not record their gender and we referred to them as other.
> - 90.5% of the users were subsciber users.
> - Most of the user's ages ranged between 20 and 60 years.
> - customer users had larger average ride durations than subscriber users.
> - The number of rides for customer users for everyday of the week were almost constant, while those for subscriber users varied highly with most rides being taken on Thursday.
> - Generally, the number of ride taken by users decrease with increase in user age for all the days of the week. It can also be observed that it's the younger users that take the longest rides for each day of the week.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I focused on the hourly and daily distribution of rides to find the busiest hour of the day and the day of the week with most rides. Then I investigated the user type, bike share, age, age group features of the users to see their distribution and interelations.
